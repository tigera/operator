# Releasing the operator

## Preparing for a release

Checkout the branch from which you want to release. For a major or minor release,
you will need to create a new `release-vX.Y` branch based on the target minor version.

Make sure the appropriate versions have been updated in `config/calico_versions.yml`, `config/enterprise_versions.yml`
or / and config/common_versions.yaml, make sure both the images have been updated and
the title field has been updated with the release (the format should be `v<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch>`).
Then ensure `make gen-versions` has been ran and the resulting updates have been committed. When updating versions
for enterprise, if necessary also update the `TigeraRegistry` field in `pkg/components/images.go`.

Make sure the branch is in a good state, e.g. Update any pins in go.mod, create PR, ensure tests pass and merge.

You should have no local changes and tests should be passing.

## Creating release

1. Review the milestone for this release and ensure it is accurate. https://github.com/tigera/operator/milestones

1. Choose a version e.g. `v1.0.1`

1. Ensure the `title:` field in both config/calico_versions.yaml and config/enterprise_versions.yaml match
   appropriate product release that the operator should install, if not see
   [Preparing for a release](#preparing-for-a-release).

1. Create a tag in git

   ```
   git tag <version>
   ```

1. Push the git tag.

1. Log in to semaphore and trigger a build on the tagged commit. Semaphore will build, test, and publish the release.

1. Run the following command to generate release notes for the release

   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=<access-token> VERSION=<TAG> ./generate-release-notes.py
   ```

1. Go to https://github.com/tigera/operator/releases and edit the release tag to include the generated release notes, and update the title.

1. Close the milestone for this release. https://github.com/tigera/operator/milestones

1. Go to https://github.com/tigera/operator/milestones and create any new milestones that should exist (e.g., next patch release)

## Updates for new Calico CRDs

If the release includes new Calico CRDs, add the new CRDs to `hack/gen-bundle/get-manifests.sh` and `config/manifests/bases/operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml`.

## Publishing a release on the RH Catalog

We currently only publish operator releases targeting Calico. If the release targets Calico, continue onto the following steps to generate the
operator bundle for it, and publish the release on the RH Catalog.

Before beginning, ensure that the docs at docs.projectcalico.org for the Calico version this operator release targets is live.

1. After the semaphore job in the releasing steps is complete, and images have been tagged and pushed, checkout the tag you released and create a new branch.

1. Login to our operator project on connect.redhat.com and publish the operator image on the RH Catalog. This step needs to happen before we generate and submit the operator bundle.

1. Create the operator bundle using `make bundle` with the required variables `VERSION`, `PREV_VERSION`, `CHANNELS`, and `DEFAULT_CHANNEL`:

   **Note**: the version strings in `VERSION` and `PREV_VERSION` are semver strings without the v.

   - **VERSION**: this release version. E.g. `1.13.1`
   - **PREV_VERSION**: the latest published bundle version in this release stream. Navigate to the [certified operators production catalog](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/certified-operators/tree/main/operators/tigera-operator) and look for the most recent version from this release branch. E.g., if this release is `v1.24.11` but the most recently published v1.24.x bundle is `1.24.9` then you would use `VERSION=1.24.11` and `PREV_VERSION=1.24.9`. If this release is the first in this release branch, then there is no prior version so set `PREV_VERSION=0.0.0`.
   - **CHANNELS** and **DEFAULT_CHANNEL**: should be set to the release branch of this operator release. E.g., if the operator release tag is `v1.23.5`, then CHANNELS and DEFAULT_CHANNEL should be `release-v1.23`.

   For example:

   ```
   make bundle VERSION=1.13.1 PREV_VERSION=1.13.0 CHANNELS=release-v1.13 DEFAULT_CHANNEL=release-v1.13
   ```

   This step will create the bundle `bundle/1.13.1`.

1. Publish the generated operator bundle following the [Operator Certification CI Pipeline instructions](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/certification-releases/blob/main/4.9/ga/ci-pipeline.md). Bundles are no longer committed in this repository as they are committed in [redhat-openshift-ecosystem/certified-operators](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/certified-operators).
