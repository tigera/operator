To install:

```bash
make hack/bin/release
```

  > [!TIP]
  > Add `hack/bin` to your `PATH` to allow running the tool using `release` command.

## Usage

To start, familiarize yourself with the tool

```sh
release --help
```

For more information on a specific command, see [Commands](#commands) section or use:

```sh
release <command> --help
```

### Build and publish a release

To build and publish a vA.B.C release, it use the `release build` and `release publish` commands.
For more information, see [release build](#release-build) and [release publish](#release-publish) sections.

Below will use the makefile target to demonstrate the usage (as expected to be run from the root of the repository).

> ![WARNING]
> This assumes user has made all the necessary changes to [prepare for the release](../RELEASING.md#preparing-for-the-release).

1. Build the operator image for version `vA.B.C`

   ```sh
   make release VERSION=vA.B.C
   ```

1. Publish the operator image to the container registry and create GitHub release.
By default, it creates a draft release.

   1. Create GitHub release as draft

     ```sh
     make release-publish VERSION=vA.B.C
     ```

     To make the draft GitHub release public, either go to the [Releases](https://github.com/tigera/operator/releases) page and publish the draft release or run locally:

     ```sh
     make release-github VERSION=vA.B.C
     ```

     This uses the `release github` command under the hood. See [release github](#release-github) section for more information.

   1. Create GitHub release and make it public directly

     ```sh
     make release-publish VERSION=vA.B.C DRAFT_GITHUB_RELEASE=false
     ```

### Build and publish a hashrelease

This is similar to [building and publishing a release](#build-and-publish-a-release), it uses the `release build` and `release publish` commands.
However, some additonal flags are used to provide more information on the Calico or Calico Enterprise version to be included in the hashrelease.
Unlike a release, a hashrelease is typically for either a Calico or Calico Enterprise version not both *though it is possible to do both but not advised*.

1. Given an operator development version `vA.B.C-0.dev-N-gHAAAAAAAAASH`

   1. Build the hashrelease operator image for Calico vX.Y.Z-0.dev-N-gSHAAAAAAAAAA

      ```sh
      make release HASHRELEASE=true VERSION=vA.B.C-0.dev-XXX-gYYYYYYYYYYYY-vX.Y.Z-0.dev-N-gSHAAAAAAAAAA \
        --calico-version vX.Y.Z-0.dev-N-gSHAAAAAAAAAA --calico-dir path/to/local/calico-repo

      # alternatively, using versions file
      # make release HASHRELEASE=true VERSION=vA.B.C-0.dev-XXX-gYYYYYYYYYYYY-vX.Y.Z-0.dev-N-gSHAAAAAAAAAA \
      #   --calico-versions path/to/calico-versions.yaml
      ```

   1. Build the hashrelease operator image for Calico Enterprise vX.Y.Z-calient-0.dev-N-gSHAAAAAAAAAA

      ```sh
      make release HASHRELEASE=true VERSION=vA.B.C-0.dev-XXX-gYYYYYYYYYYYY-vX.Y.Z-calient-0.dev-N-gSHAAAAAAAAAA \
        --enterprise-version vX.Y.Z-calient-0.dev-N-gSHAAAAAAAAAA --enterprise-dir path/to/local/enterprise-repo

      # alternatively, using versions file
      # make release HASHRELEASE=true VERSION=vA.B.C-0.dev-XXX-gYYYYYYYYYYYY-vX.Y.Z-calient-0.dev-N-gSHAAAAAAAAAA \
      #   --enterprise-versions path/to/enterprise-versions.yaml
      ```

1. Publish the hashrelease operator image to the container registry.

   1. For Calico hashrelease

     ```sh
     make release-publish HASHRELEASE=true VERSION=vA.B.C-0.dev-XXX-gYYYYYYYYYYYY-vX.Y.Z-0.dev-N-gSHAAAAAAAAAA
     ```

   1. For Calico Enterprise hashrelease

     ```sh
     make release-publish HASHRELEASE=true VERSION=vA.B.C-0.dev-XXX-gYYYYYYYYYYYY-vX.Y.Z-calient-0.dev-N-gSHAAAAAAAAAA
     ```

## Commands

### release build

This command builds the operator image for a specific operator version.

To build the operator image, use the following command:

```sh
release build --version <operator version>
```

For hashrelease, use the `--hashrelease` flag and provide either the Calico or Calico Enterprise version or versions file.
When using Calico or/and Calico Enterprise version, the local directory of the respective repository must be provided.
When using versions file, provide the path to the local director of the respective repository if local changes are to be included;
otherwise, the latest commit for the respective

```sh
release build --version <operator version> --hashrelease \
  [--calico-version <calico version> | --calico-versions <path to calico version file> |--enterprise-version <enterprise version> | --enterprise-versions <path to enterprise version file>] [--calico-dir <path to local calico repo> | --enterprise-dir <path to local enterprise repo>]
```

#### Examples

1. To build the operator image for operator version `v1.36.0`

    ```sh
    release build --version v1.36.0
    ```

1. To build hashrelease operator image for Calico v3.30

   1. Using Calico versions file

         ```sh
         release build --hashrelease --version v1.36.0-0.dev-259-g25c811f78fbd-v3.30.0-0.dev-338-gca80474016a5 \
          --calico-versions path/to/calico-versions.yaml
         ```

   1. Specifying version directly

       ```sh
       release build --hashrelease --version v1.36.0-0.dev-259-g25c811f78fbd-v3.30.0-0.dev-338-gca80474016a5 \
        --calico-version v3.30.0-0.dev-338-gca80474016a5 --calico-dir path/to/local/calico-repo
       ```

1. To build hashrelease operator image for Calico Enterprise v3.22

   1. Using Enterprise versions file

         ```sh
         release build --hashrelease --version v1.36.0-0.dev-259-g25c811f78fbd-v3.22.0-calient-0.dev-100-gabcdef123456 \
          --enterprise-versions path/to/enterprise-versions.yaml
         ```

   1. Specifying version directly

       ```sh
       release build --hashrelease --version v1.36.0-0.dev-259-g25c811f78fbd-v3.22.0-calient-0.dev-100-gabcdef123456 \
        --enterprise-version v3.22.0-calient-0.dev-100-gabcdef123456 --enterprise-dir path/to/local/enterprise-repo
       ```

1. *Not typically recommended*, but to build hashrelease operator image for both Calico v3.30 and Calico Enterprise v3.22

   1. Using versions file

         ```sh
         release build --hashrelease --version v1.36.0-0.dev-259-g25c811f78fbd-v3.30.0-0.dev-338-gca80474016a5-v3.22.0-calient-0.dev-100-gabcdef123456 \
          --calico-versions path/to/calico-versions.yaml --enterprise-versions path/to/enterprise-versions.yaml
         ```

   1. Specifying versions directly

       ```sh
       release build --hashrelease --version v1.36.0-0.dev-259-g25c811f78fbd-v3.30.0-0.dev-338-gca80474016a5-v3.22.0-calient-0.dev-100-gabcdef123456 \

        --enterprise-version v3.22.0-calient-0.dev-100-gabcdef123456 --enterprise-dir path/to/local/enterprise-repo
       ```

### release publish

This commands publishes the operator image for a specific operator version to a container registry.

```sh
release publish --version <operator version>
```

For hashrelease, use the `--hashrelease` flag

```sh
release publish --version <operator version> --hashrelease
```

If this is a release version (i.e. vX.Y.Z) and the `--create-github-release` flag is set to true,
it creates a draft release on the [Releases](https://github.com/tigera/operator/releases) page.

#### Examples

1. To publish the operator version `v1.36.0`

    ```sh
    release publish --version v1.36.0
    ```

1. To publish the hashrelease operator image for operator v1.36 with Calico v3.30

    ```sh
    release publish --version v1.36.0-0.dev-259-g25c811f78fbd-v3.30.0-0.dev-338-gca80474016a5 --hashrelease
    ```

1. To publish the operator version `v1.36.0` and create a GitHub release

    ```sh
    release publish --version v1.36.0 --create-github-release
    ```

### release prep

This command prepares the repo for a new release.
This typically involves updating the versions config files, image registry for the product if applicable,
and re-generating any generated files.
All the changes are committed to a new branch, which is then pushed to the remote
and a pull request is created against the release branch for review.
Finally, it manages the milestones on GitHub for the release stream associated with the new release,
which involves creating a new milestone for the next patch version and closing the current milestone
for the release version. All open issues and pull requests associated with the current milestone
are moved to the new milestone.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > At least one of Calico or Calico Enterprise version must be specified.
  > If both are specified, the versions files for both products are updated.

To prepare for a new release, use the following command:

```sh
release prep --version <new operator version> [--calico-version <calico version> |
--enterprise-version <calico enterprise version>]
```

If the `--local` flag is specified, none of the remote changes will be made i.e.
no branch in the remote repo and no pull request will be created. Also milestones will not be modified on GitHub.

#### Examples

1. To prepare for a new release `v1.36.0` with Calico version `v3.30.0`

    ```sh
    release prep --version v1.36.0 --calico-version v3.30.0
    ```

1. To prepare for a new release `v1.36.0` with Calico Enterprise version `v3.20.0-1.0`

    ```sh
    release prep --version v1.36.0 --enterprise-version v3.20.0-1.0
    ```

1. To prepare for a new release `v1.36.0` with Calico version `v3.30.0`
   and Calico Enterprise version `v3.20.0-1.0` using local changes only

    ```sh
    release prep --version v1.36.0 --calico-version v3.30.0 --enterprise-version v3.20.0-1.0 --local
    ```

### release notes

This command generates release notes for a specific operator version.
To generate release notes, use the following command:

```sh
release notes --version <operator version>
```

The generated releases notes are saved in a markdown file named `<operator version>-release-notes.md`.

The release notes includes the Calico and Calico Enterprise versions included in the operator version.
By default, this is gotten from the versions files corresponding to the product in `config/` directory
in the commit with the tag matching the operator version.

To get the versions file from the local working directory instead of the tagged commit, use the `--local` flag.

#### Examples

1. To generate release notes for operator version `v1.36.0` from the tagged commit

    ```sh
    release notes --version v1.36.0
    ```

1. To generate release notes for operator version `v1.36.0` using the local versions files

    ```sh
    release notes --version v1.36.0 --local
    ```

### release github

This command creates or updates a GitHub release for a specific operator version.
To create or update a GitHub release, use the following command:

```sh
release github --version <operator version>
```

By default, the GitHub release is not created in draft mode. To create a draft release, use the `--draft` flag.

#### Examples

1. To create or update a GitHub release for operator version `v1.36.0`

    ```sh
    release github --version v1.36.0
    ```

1. To create or update a draft GitHub release for operator version `v1.36.0`

    ```sh
    release github --version v1.36.0 --draft
    ```

### release from

This command creates a new operator version based on a previous operator version.
The base operator version must reference either a tag or commit hash in `tigera/operator`.
The new operator version will be built from the current codebase
with updates made to the image list based on the changes passed in.

```sh
release from --base-version <previous operator version> --version <version to release> \
  [--except-calico | --except-calico-enterprise] <image>:<image version>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To publish the newly created operator, use the `--publish` flag
>
> `--publish` will push the operator image to remote repository
> and ONLY create a draft release on the [Releases](https://github.com/tigera/operator/releases) page for release versions (i.e. vX.Y.Z)

#### Examples

1. To create a new operator with an updated `typha` for Calico to a custom registry locally

    ```sh
    release from --base-version v1.36.0-1.dev-259-g25c811f78fbd-v3.30.0-0.dev-338-gca80474016a5 --version v1.36.0-mod-typha \
    --except-calico typha:v3.30.0-0.dev-353-ge0bc56c0d646 --registry quay.io --image my-namespace/tigera-operator
    ```

1. To create a new operator with an updated `typha` for Calico to a custom registry

    ```sh
    release from --base-version v1.36.0-1.dev-259-g25c811f78fbd-v3.30.0-0.dev-338-gca80474016a5 --version v1.36.0-mod-typha \
    --except-calico typha:v3.30.0-0.dev-353-ge0bc56c0d646 --registry quay.io --image my-namespace/tigera-operator --publish
    ```

1. To create a new operator release `v1.36.3` that has almost all the same images as `v1.36.2`
    with the exception of Enterprise `linseed` component using `v3.20.0-2.2` locally.

    > [!WARNING]
    > This assumes that user has push access to [`tigera/operator`](https://github.com/tigera/operator)

    ```sh
    release from --base-version v1.36.2 --version v1.36.3 \
      --except-calico-enterprise linseed:v3.20.0-2.2
    ```
