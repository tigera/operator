// represents the currently installed resources.

// - mark incompatible clusters by returning a IncompatibleClusterError
// - carry user config forward by setting the Installation resource according to the installed config
// - mark variables as 'checked' so that the final env var catch-all doesn't throw an 'unexpected env var' error
