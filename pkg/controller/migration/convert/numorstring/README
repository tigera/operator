The package numorstring is copied from projectcalico/calico (the code is currently at the path api/pkg/lib/numorstring)i
so that we can convert felix env vars which map to felixconfiguration fields of type numorstring.

These files are also added to git-hooks/files-to-skip because they have been copied without modification and it is
necessary to skip them since the Copyright notice hasn't been updated.
