                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
