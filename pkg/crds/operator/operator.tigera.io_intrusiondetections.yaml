                      used to provision disks for the Anomaly Detection API pod for

                      API will be using EmptyDir VolumeSource. The StorageClassName
                      should only be modified when no StorageClass is currently active.
                      We recommend choosing a storage class dedicated to AnomalyDetection
                      only. Otherwise, model retention cannot be guaranteed during
