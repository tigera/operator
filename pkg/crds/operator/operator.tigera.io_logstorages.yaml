                      Snapshots configures the retention period for snapshots, in days. Snapshots are periodic captures
                      of resources which along with audit events are used to generate reports.
                      Consult the Compliance Reporting documentation for more details on snapshots.
                      Logs written on a day that started at least this long ago are
                      removed.  To keep logs for at least x days, use a retention period of x+1.

                  StorageClassName will populate the PersistentVolumeClaim.StorageClassName that is used to provision disks to the
                  Tigera Elasticsearch cluster. The StorageClassName should only be modified when no LogStorage is currently
                  active. We recommend choosing a storage class dedicated to Tigera LogStorage only. Otherwise, data retention
                  cannot be guaranteed during upgrades. See https://docs.tigera.io/maintenance/upgrading for up-to-date instructions.
