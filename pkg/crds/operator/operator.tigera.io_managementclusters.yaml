          The presence of ManagementCluster in your cluster, will configure it to be the management plane to which managed
          clusters can connect. At most one instance of this resource is supported. It must be named "tigera-secure".

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.

                description: |-
                  This field specifies the externally reachable address to which your managed cluster will connect. When a managed
                  cluster is added, this field is used to populate an easy-to-apply manifest that will connect both clusters.
                  Valid examples are: "0.0.0.0:31000", "example.com:32000", "[::1]:32500"

                  secretName:
                    description: |-
                      SecretName indicates the name of the secret in the tigera-operator namespace that contains the private key and certificate that the management cluster uses when it listens for incoming connections.
                      When set to tigera-management-cluster-connection voltron will use the same cert bundle which Guardian client certs are signed with.
                      When set to manager-tls, voltron will use the same cert bundle which Manager UI is served with.
                      This cert bundle must be a publicly signed cert created by the user.
                      Note that Tigera Operator will generate a self-signed manager-tls cert if one does not exist,
                      and use of that cert will result in Guardian being unable to verify Voltron's identity.
                      If changed on a running cluster with connected managed clusters, all managed clusters will disconnect as they will no longer be able to verify Voltron's identity.
                      To reconnect existing managed clusters, change the tls.ca of the  managed clusters' ManagementClusterConnection resource.
