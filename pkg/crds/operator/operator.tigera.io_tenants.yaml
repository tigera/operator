                                  Affinity is a group of affinity scheduling rules for the calico-kube-controllers pods.
                                  If specified, this overrides any affinity that may be set on the calico-kube-controllers Deployment.
                                  If omitted, the calico-kube-controllers Deployment will use its default value for affinity.
                                  WARNING: Please note that this field will override the default calico-kube-controllers Deployment affinity.
