// the standard operator flow, where we add watches after the controller has been created (watches for objects that rely
// on the API Server that's created by the operator).

// The controller.Controller interface now requires using a cache to set up the watches, while the ctrl.Builder interface
// is tailored to creating watches before the manager / controller has been started.
